<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonds and equities are the twin giants of the investing world. And while bonds are not as glamorous as stocks; they are the foundation of the financial world and offer a boring yet (mostly) stable yield. Let's very briefly talk about yields and then get into bonds with three questions: What is the anatomy of a bond? Where can you find bonds? And what are bond credit ratings?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Because I do not have an article explaining yield I am going to just briefly explain it here: Yields are all around us and can be found in almost everything we do. At it's most basic definition a yield is the return. It doesn't even have to be a return on an investment. For instance if you give 2 eggs to a friend and he gives you 3 eggs back then you got a yield of 1 egg (50%): Even if you expected to lose those 2 eggs and get none back. If you buy a company at $100 a share and then sell when it goes up to $120 a share. Then the yield was $20 (20%). If you study for an hour and get a 20% higher score than you did on your first attempt of a quiz: Then your yield for the hour of studying was 20%. In general you should not care about the nominal value. You should only care about the percentage gain or loss.</p>

### The Anatomy of a bond:

<p>A bond is a basic tool of investment which really only has four parts to it: <p>

- Principal
- Yield
- Coupon(s)
- Maturity Date

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First there is the principal. This is the cost of the bond that an investor would pay to own the bond. Next is the yield the bond offers. This is the percentage of the principal you get every year from coupons. Next is coupons, if your bond offers a 5% yield and you get coupons every 6 months then you will get 2 2.5% coupons. Next you have the maturity date. This is the date your bond will mature. Some bonds will offer a single coupon at the end of your bond's maturity date while other bonds will have a coupon say every month. And some others may have a coupon every year. Typically the coupon is every 6 months. But no matter what the amount of coupons offered or where there is one thing in common for all bonds. You will get your principal back at the Maturity Date*. It is important to note that just because there are more coupons offered by a bond when compared to another that does <b>NOT</b> mean the bond will be worth more or offer a higher overall yield.<p> 

*Assuming the borrower does not default. This is why I had a "(mostly)" in the opening paragraph.

#### A brief example:

<p>let's say you buy a 2yr bond with a 5% yield which pays a coupon out every 6 months for $1000. Right off the bat you will lose $1000 but gain the bond.<br>

- 6 months later you will receive a 2.5% yield or $25 coupon. 
  - Note: 2.5% comes from (5%/(12months/6months)).<br>
- Another 6 months later you will receive a 2.5% yield or $25 coupon. 
  - This is the end of the first year. 
  - At this point you will have a 5% yield bond maturing in 1 year for $1000 and $50 from earlier coupons.<br> 
- Another 6 months later you will receive a 2.5% yield or $25 coupon.<br>
- Another 6 months later your bond will mature and you will receive your last coupon. 
  - Today you receive your $1000 principal and your final $25 coupon bringing your total up to $1100. 
  
Congratulations, you are an investor!</p>

### Where are bonds found?:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost any entity that borrows money will be working with bonds. Companies offer bonds, Governments offer bonds, hell when you get a mortgage from a bank it is owned in the form of a mortgage bond. The typical retirement portfolio consists of 60% bonds and 40% equities. This is so common place that it is called the 60-40 portfolio. Bonds from a blue chip companies will be called blue chip bonds. Bonds from governments are called government bonds. The vast majority of the time if you're dealing with debt you are dealing with bonds.</p>

<p>But why even deal with bonds in the first place? Doesn't the government get money from taxes? Don't companies get money by selling products or services? Can't they use that money when buying products or services? Well they could, but that would be inefficient and sometimes it's better for capital to be allocated in debt. Now I'm not going to get into capital allocation or economic efficiency because they are topics that are very advanced. All you need to know is that to fund current projects-which may or may not be needed-the entity (company, government, etc) may need to borrow cash. When the entity starts borrowing then it becomes a gamble for the giver/creditor. Do they get a return? Are they throwing money away? Will the borrower just leave them in the dust? To answer these questions a framework is put in place. Firstly, laws binding borrowers to bond contracts is created. Next a bond credit rating is placed on the borrower. And to top it all off the creditor will only offer capital in exchange for a bond if the yield suits them. No one is forced to buy a bond they don't want.</p>

### What are bond credit ratings?:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid letting the vast majority of creditors loan to entities without a basic risk acknowledgement a bond credit rating system is put in place. It is important for this system to be put in place otherwise a nation will have credit crisis more often, and for the sake of a nation's health a credit crises is to be avoided at almost any cost. Putting a basic bond credit rating is a very cheap way to avoid a large portion of credit crises. As far as I know the entire world uses this bond credit rating system. To receive a rating from one of the Big Three credit rating agencies (Moody's, S&P, Fitch aka the "Big Three") a borrower has to pay a fee. This is a conflict of interest which at times is a problem. Why would a borrower not "shop" around for a rating which favors them?</p>

<p> A borrower can be given a rating on a AAA to D scale. The Big Three all have their own spin on it but essentially here is the scale where AAA means there is a ~0% chance of default while a D means they have defaulted in some way.

- AAA
- AA
- A
- BBB
- BB
- B
- CCC
- CC
- C
- D

AA through B all have + and - possibilities too. So for instance it is possible can have a rating of AA+, B-, BBB+, A-, or just AA.<br>

Why then, would someone buy a bond from a CC credit rated entity when they could buy a bond from a AA credit rated entity? Well it's simple really. The lower the potential borrower's bond credit rating is the higher the yield the potential borrower will have to offer to become a borrower. No one wants to lose their investment, so there will always be a reason for investors to be cautious and seek safety. They will thus climb the ratings ladder to the highest bond credit rating for their investment (AAA). A potential borrower-as a CC rated entity-needs to entice investors to their bonds. How do they do it? Offer more money! In this case it come in the form of higher yields.

Because I just briefly talked about the credit rating I am going to link the wikipedia page for it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating). You may want to check out the Criticisms section of the wikipedia page. This rating system has flaws and at times they are <b>massive</b>.

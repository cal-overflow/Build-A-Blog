The 9am Meeting started off as a face-to-face meeting between Nick Villotti and his co-workers at Cellular Advantage. The idea was written about by the company’s CEO – Doug Ecklund – in the book [The 9 a.m. Meeting](https://www.amazon.com/m-Meeting-High-Impact-Meaningful-Energizing-ebook/dp/B01GGUS9T6).

Doug Ecklund came into contact with Spencer Dunham, Trevor Johnson, and I through the Waukee APEX program. He was looking for help creating a prototype website called The 9am Meeting. The idea of The 9am Meeting website was to allow employees from all different branches of Cellular Advantage to track their personal life goals online and be able to interact with remote employees.

By the end of summer 2019, the project was completed and turned over to Doug and his employees to use. The website was not used all that much by Doug or his employees. However, I learned a great deal about working on a big project with other team members and communicating professionally with Cellular Advantage.

What I learned about while working on this project:

  - SQL (working with databases)
  - Website encryption & SSL certification
  - The basics of PHP
  - Session ID’s & Cookies (WordPress Nonces)
  - User interface
  - Customizing WordPress page templates

**Built with:** Heavily customized WordPress, SSL Certificate, & dedicated hosting

**Note:** Since Cellular Advantage does no longer uses the website, the SSL certificates have been removed, meaning the website is no longer securely encrypted.

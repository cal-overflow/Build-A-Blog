Computer Science 309 (Software Development Practices) is a course at Iowa State University that provides most students with their first software development-project experience. Students are taught the basics of GitLab (version control platform), MySQL databases, Android Studio, and Spring Boot.

<!--more-->

With this rudimentary knowledge, students are then allotted most of the semester to work on their group project. In this post, I will list what I learned and describe my experience in this class. Although my group did not complete the semester with a fully functional Android application, I learned a great deal about working on the backend since we fully implemented that as we had initially hoped.

### Major Topics Covered
  - Self-teaching new frameworks (Spring Boot)
  - Usage of version-control systems (GitLab)
  - Maintenance of code/database
  - MySQL data relationships (i.e. one-to-many)
  - CRUDL
  - Development with REST
  - Testing Code (Mockito)
  - Teamwork with software development

# RedPen

At the start of the course, groups were made up of four members (two frontend and two backend). Students were only expected to have a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (as the only COM S prerequisites are [227](/post/com-s-227) and [228](/post/com-s-228)). The entire semester is then given to each group as time to work on an approved project.

My group, which consisted of only sophomores with relatively little software development experience, decided to create a school grading system in the form of an Android application named RedPen. Our frontend was responsible for creating the Android application, and the backend responsible for creating and managing both the database (MySQL) and the Spring Boot application.

Fellow group member [Carter Moseley](http://cartermoseley.com/) and I decided to work on the backend with virtually no-experience building and maintaining MySQL databases or working with Spring Boot between the two of us. The frontend was to be developed by our two other group members.

While Carter and I were in the process of learning Spring Boot, MySQL, and building a functional backend, our frontend members quickly ran into trouble. One of our group members had experienced a concussion and could not commit any work for the entire semester. Our other frontend member showed a lack of interest in the project and was unmotivated to make much progress.

The semester went on, though, as Carter and I developed a fully functional backend with Spring Boot and MySQL. With a couple of busy weeks remaining in the semester, and little work left to be done on the backend, Carter stepped up and began learning the basics of Android Studio and implemented a few basic login screens.

Ultimately, as the semester came to an end, RedPen’s backend had developed into a fully functional backend application capable of interacting with the database. It was entirely capable of everything we had initially hoped it would be in the planning stages of the semester. On the other hand, the frontend was left in the state of only a few basic screens. Overall, RedPen was a failure.

Although the group project was more or less a failure, our group learned a lot from it. I learned how to build and manage the backend side of an application, along with using Version Control Software (Git), and all of the other major topics listed above. There are many things that everyone, including myself, could have done differently with this project, but at the end of the day, I am proud of the work that I contributed to RedPen.

This video demonstrates the functionality of RedPen. In the first four minutes of the video, Carter briefly showcases some of the work he did for RedPen. You can skip to timestamp [4:03](https://youtu.be/W9jD102f-Wc?t=243) to see my demonstration and explanation of some of my work on RedPen.

## What did I do?

Both Carter and I contributed a large amount of work toward the backend. We took a while to develop the backend structure, but once we figured that out, the resulting work was split between us. Below is a table of the many different backend features implemented by Carter and myself, as well as an image of the database structure.
